### Overview of the project:

A task manager for households based on the Fair Play system.

This application is aiming to more equitably distribute mental-load, emotional labor, second-shift, and invisible work amongst members of a household, with or without kids or pets and within or outside of romantic relationships.

The need for this application became clear when I read Eve Rodsky's Fair Play. Using the system she created as a base, I wanted to create an application which streamlines the implementation and management of the system for each household and its members.

### User Stories:

1. As a user, I can login to the application.
2. As a user, I can create a household by adding other users and marking whether the household contains pets, children, or a romantic relationship.
3. As a user belonging to a newly created household, I can agree to the community agreement.
4. As a user belonging to a household with all members submitting to a community agreement, I can view auto generated cards (stretch), submit cards for value declaration to other household members.
5. As a user belonging to a household where all members have gone through each card with their value declaration, I can view the chart of daily grind tasks, what our household values, and what only I value.
6. As a user that has viewed the chart, I can assign cards to household members. 
7. As a user that belongs to a household where all cards are assigned, I can take a vow. 
8. As a user that belongs to a household where all members have taken a vow, I can view my assigned cards and submit for the deck to be re-dealt. 
9. As a user that belongs to a household where all members have agreed to re-deal the deck, our household cards become unassigned and our household step reverts back to 6.
10. Repeat user story 6-9 as needed.
